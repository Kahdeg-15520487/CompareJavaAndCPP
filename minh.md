| Operator overloading for most operators. Preserving meaning (semantics) is highly recommended.  | Operators are not overridable. The language overrides + and += for the String class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Const-ness is propagated as a means to enforce, at compile-time, correctness of the code with respect to mutability of objects (see const-correctness).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | final provides a version of const, equivalent to type* const pointers for objects and const for primitive types. Immutability of object members achieved via read-only interfaces and object encapsulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Source code can be written to be cross-platform (can be compiled for Windows, BSD, Linux, macOS, Solaris, etc., without modification) and written to use platform-specific features. Typically compiled into native machine code, must be recompiled for each target platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Compiled into byte code for the JVM. Byte code is dependent on the Java platform, but is typically independent of operating system specific features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
